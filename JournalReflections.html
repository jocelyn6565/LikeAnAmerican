	Being American is not the same for everyone. Being American depends on where you come from and your families descendants. She said she had never seen so much diversity in America until she moved from her hometown to the bay area. “Growing up where I lived I didn’t see the diversity in America.” Jen said she believes anyone who has lived here in America that feels culturally connected or just simply considers themselves American is an American. Jen came from Deptford, New Jersey. Her hometown was filled with farms and people had been there for a really long time. The farms and owned land was passed down from generations behind. She believes that her American dream is, “Work hard and get what you feel is success.” She means everyone has a different definition of success. Jen believes she is living her American dream because she feels she is a hard worker and has the success she deserves. One of the challenges she feels there is being an American is that America influences many other countries, and said “It is a huge responsibility.” Jen Selby is feels she is different from other American around her because she is a Computer Scientist, “I am a little bit nerdier.” She has been coding since she was in highschool, starting to program calculators which sparked her passion for programing. She pursued her passion and is not a programmer. She believes that there is a high demand for women engineers and she wants to help end the gender gap. She taught a class of twenty high school girls the basics of programing and has helped inspire them to pursue a career in Computer Science. </font></p>

She says, “There is no other country I would call my home other than America.” A proud citizen of America and happy to be Indian and live in America. She says she feels very lucky to have been born in America and to live the life she is living now. She was talking about her cousins in India, and said that she would’ve been married and with a kid by now if she were in India. She is not married and has no child because her parents decided to come live to America. She is not in college and says her parents always tried to give her the best education and always wants her to succeed. Nitika says that her American dream is to work hard and help others. I asked if she was living her American dream she responded, “No, because I am still in college.” She said her parents are living the American dream because they have gave her and her sister the best education they could've gave them. She said her future plans are to graduate college, get a good job, have a family and have enough resources to live comfortably. She wants to be able to support a family, “I want to give them what they need without there being a struggle.” As I asked her what she believes is an american struggle she responded to me by saying, “Theres like crazy rich people, but theres also crazy poor people.” She says that this is a challenge because theres a huge difference between people. Nitka believes that the major diversity in America is a really great change because you see many people daily that come from different countries or cultures. She said she is distinguished from other Americans because she is Indian and a woman in Engineering. She aspires to get more women in engineering, “Yay! Girls Who Code!” She wants to help reduce the gender gap in engineering and is helping by being a Teachers Assistant in a program called Girls Who Code. She says she is also different because she doesn't just want to be a housewife, “Theres nothing wrong with being a housewife, but its definitely something I do not aspire.” Nitika Daga, a woman with many goals in life and a passion to succeed in America.</font></p>

	Ellen DaSilva 

	Ellen Dasilva, being born and raised in America said she feels extremely lucky to be a part of the family she was born with. She has traveled a lot and has had the best education her parents could give her. She was born in New York City and is now living in the bay area. She feels very lucky to be able to do all the things she does and all the things she has also done in the past, “I feel very lucky to live here and have studied” Ellen said. She is really interested in politics and cares about other Americans having education and having enough knowledge about what is going on around them politically. As I asked her, if there is one thing you could change in America what would it be? Ellen said, “I just wished in general Americans were more open minded.” She explained to me that when it comes to politics Americans just vote or talk without having enough knowledge to make good decisions. She said she also wants Americans to be more knowledgeable about what’s going on in their country.  Ellen is concerned a lot about politics because she has a background in politics and also worked in the Hillary Clinton campaign. As she grew up she didn’t struggle much as she said she had a great education and her parents always did their best to supply her with everything she needed. She also said traveling is a big part of her life, she has traveled to many places such as Borneo Indonesia. When I asked what she believed the American dream was she responded by saying that the American dream is to have tons of wealth and many resources, but to also recognize that we are extremely lucky to be where we are. Ellen DaSilva, a Caucasian woman who is proud to be where she is now, working in finances at the Twitter Headquarters.

	What I've Learned

	Interviewing three different women that were born in America has really made me learn a lot. I have learned not all Americans are the same. There are many different cultures in America and a lot of diversity. Being an American is different for everyone depending on where you grew up and your cultural background. People also have different opportunities based on connections their family has and the support their family gave them. I learned that people have different perspectives about what the American dream really is, I realized that the American dream does not just mean to be legalized and get a job. I learned that even American citizens have American dreams such as helping others and being successful. Success means different things to different people. I also learned that people have different goals in life and see different problems in America. When I asked Jen what she thought was a struggle in America she said gender gap in CS and she said that America has too much influence in other countries. When I asked Nitika, she said a problem in America was that there is crazy rich people, but then there is also crazy poor people. And then when I asked Ellen she said that a problem in America she sees a lot is people not being knowledgeable enough about politics and problems going on in America.

	Key Themes And Perspectives

	A key theme I kept on hearing while interviewing Jen, Nitika, and Ellen was that being an American is different for everyone. Being an American does not just have one meaning. Being an American depends on where you come from and your cultural experiences.  I also noticed that they all had different dreams and goals to accomplish. This is because they all came from different places and different family cultures. They all had different struggles which reflects on different goals they have now. Something else I noticed was that although their American dreams were different they all still involved success. Everyone wants to be successful, but success means something different to every individual.
